feat: Enhance article metadata display and styling

This commit introduces several enhancements to how article metadata (tags, categories, and dates) is displayed and styled, improving readability and user experience.

Why:
- To provide clear visual distinction between tags and categories.
- To display article publication and last modification dates for better context.
- To alert users when an article is older than one year, indicating potentially outdated information.
- To improve the overall aesthetic and organization of article metadata.

How:
- **Tags & Categories Display**:
    - Modified `themes/my-high-contrast-theme/layouts/_default/home.html` and `themes/my-high-contrast-theme/layouts/page.html` to display `hugo_tags` and `hugo_categories` directly from page parameters.
    - Encapsulated tags and categories within a `post-meta-tags-categories` div, with individual items styled using `tag-item` and `category-item` classes.
    - Removed previous emoji and text labels for a cleaner look.
- **Styling**:
    - Updated `assets/custom.css` to define distinct background colors and borders for `tag-item` (light gray) and `category-item` (vibrant blue) for clear visual separation.
    - Adjusted margins and padding for a more compact and organized appearance.
    - Added styling for `post-dates` to control date display.
    - Set `old-article-warning` color to a darker yellow (`#DAA520`) for better contrast in light mode.
- **Date Display**:
    - Modified `themes/my-high-contrast-theme/layouts/page.html` to display both publication date and last modification date.
    - Implemented logic to show last modification date only if it differs from the publication date.
    - Added a warning message for articles older than one year, calculated using `time.ParseDuration`.
- **CSS Loading**:
    - Corrected `themes/my-high-contrast-theme/layouts/partials/head/css.html` to explicitly load `custom.css`, ensuring custom styles are applied.
